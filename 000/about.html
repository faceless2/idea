<p>
Moves the "Help cousins find this profile" action to inside the "Profile Manager" box,

<h3>If approved</h3>
<p>
Move the DIV containing that text to immediately after the "This page has been accessed NNN times" 
paragraph, and add the class "float-lg-end". To align with the "Problems or Questions" button above
it, also set "margin-right: 0" on the button

<h1>Move the "profile manager" box to the right column</h1>

As title says. The main purpose here is to pull the Biography up - there were
many complaints about things being too far down the page, to spaced out etc.

Moving the box is fairly obvious, but the content of the box is all left aligned and
full width, not floated right. I also set the top-margin of "Biography" to "mt-0" and the
bottom margin of the "aside" box to "mt-3"

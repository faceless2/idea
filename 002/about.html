<h1>Move the "profile manager" box to the right column</h1>
<p>
As title says. The main purpose here is to pull the Biography up - there were
many complaints about things being too far down the page, to spaced out etc.

<h3>If approved</h3>

Moving the box is fairly obvious, but the content of the box is all left aligned and
full width, not floated right. I also set the top-margin of "Biography" to "mt-0" and the
bottom margin of the "aside" box to "mt-3"

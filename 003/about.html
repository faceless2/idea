<h1>Make "Top" a regular button"
<p>
Change the "Top" button from an icon to a regular text button like Tree, Biography, and hide
the "Bottom" button. It's not really clear why "Top" needs to be different? It does the same
thing a the others, so making one of them an icon and the rest text feels odd. The "Bottom"
button - why? There's nothing there! If it's reinstated I'd suggest moving it after the 
"Matches" section.

<h3>If approved</h3>

Change is very obvious.

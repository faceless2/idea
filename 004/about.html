<h1>Add a count of comments and sources to the top links</h1>
<p>
Super easy change which seems useful for two reasons. First, it may encourage people to 
add and format their sources (it only counts LI elements), and if there are comments
counted at the top it might encourage a casual visitor to a page to scroll down,
which might improve engagement, and might also show a few more adverts...

<h3>If approved</h3>
<p>
Change is obvious - for "source" I'm counting LI children of any UL and OL objects
that are siblings of the "Sources" header, until the next section. I did the same
for comments - the number of items matched by "#comments.container .comment" - but
you've obviously got this information already so could set it on the server just as
easily.

<h1>Helpful fields</h3>
<p>
This makes three changes to the edit fields</p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The prefix/suffix fields are limited to 10 characters, because that's what they're
limited to in the database! I don't know the length limits on other fields, but they're
all currently given a maxlength of 60 - if the limits are different for a particular
field, they should be set to that limit. <b>Without this, data is truncated when saving</b>.
This one really is a no-brainer.
</li>
<li>
Text fields have leading/trailing whitespace trimmed when their values are changed.
Only applies to single line fields, eg names, places - <b>not</b> the biography.
</li>
<li>
When a Death Date/Place is set to "still living", the value of the field is reset
to empty and the field is disabled. To me this is an obvious validation step before
saving, but I appreciate there are probably many profiles that already have a date/place
and yet are also "still living". It won't affect those at all - the value is only
changed if the status is <b>changed</b> to "still living".
</li>
</ol>
<h3>If approved</h3>
<p>
maxlength is best set on the server side when creating the pages.
The other two are "change" listeners which are added
to the appropriate fields. They can easily be copied directly from <a href="script.js">script.js</a>
or equivalents written, they're only a few lines.

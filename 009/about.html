<h1>Compact: promote birth/date to header</h1>
<p>
This moves the birth/date values from the "Family" tab to the header.
To make room, it moves the copy icons to the right.
</p><p>
There are some slight issues with this, mainly when the window is extremely narrow.
If this suggestion is adopted I'm happy to help restyle this properly for small screens.

<h3>If approved</h3>
<p>
Move the birth/death boxes from the "familyVitals" tab" to the header, in a div immediately
after the H1. Move the "copy--icons" to immediately after the privacy icon, and
apply <a href="style.css">style.css</a>

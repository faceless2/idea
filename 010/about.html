<h1>Make Tree Apps first-class citizens</h1>
<p>
This is just a proof of concept, but in theory you could have (probably) a subset
of tree apps here, one on each tab. I suggest a subset because some (ie one name tree)
are not directly related to an individual, so may not make much sense when you have
the biography of an individual below. But many (SlippyTree, Family Timeline etc)
could work quite well here.

Other approaches could be an iframe rather than adding directly to the page, and there
could be a "plus" tab which allows a user to choose other apps, or to select which
apps they want on tabs.

<h3>If approved</h3>

Actually not a lot of work here - for SlippyTree I had to create a "View" class, and
most apps rely on the WikiTreeAPI class too so that would need importing. Managing
which apps are on tabs could be done client side with cookies if no server side
changes are wanted at this stage of development. This is a good place for the "app
chooser" pane that's been discussed.

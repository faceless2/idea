<h1>Scrolling tree-app support</h1>
<p>
There are quite a few tree-apps that try to manage scrolling themselves:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Slippy Tree</li>
<li>Super Tree</li>
<li>Couples Dynamic Tree</li>
<li>Fractal Tree</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>
The current design tries to manage this by giving them a fixed height, eg 1000px,
and letting them work within that. A better approach would be using Flex to fill
the screen, making the #view-container fill available space in that space and
making it scrollable, so things inside the #view-container can be dragged around.
A scrollable view-container <b>would fix all the tearing problems</b>.
</p>
<p>
This patch shows how it could be done: by adding a stylesheet and setting the HTML
element to have a "main-scrolls" class, it changes the page to a flex layout,
reduces the footer size (unless the mouse hovers over it) and makes #view-container
the scrollpane.
</p></p>
A tree-app could take advantage of this by adding "main-scrolls" class to the root element
and making a few simple changes to how they manage scrolling. Even without those changes,
hopefully from what's there now you can get an idea of how it would work.
</p>
<h3>If approved</h3>
<p>
This one involves changes to any apps that want to make use of this scrolling mechanism,
but the changes are simple and Mike is happy to help authors and/or apply them himself.
There's also a <a href="style.css">stylesheet</a> and a one-line event handler to manage
mouseenter/mouseleave on the footer.
